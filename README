= Flex 4 LoginForm Component

  Greg Jastrab <greg@smartlogicsolutions.com>
  
  NOTE: This version was built using the 7297 revision on the Flex SDK trunk.

== DESCRIPTION

The LoginForm is a Flex 4 component which encapsulates a login form containing:
 * login & password labels
 * login & password inputs
 * login button
 * login message

A test application and sample skin are provided.

A LoginEvent is dispatched when the login button is pressed, which triggers a state change
to the "loggingIn" state.  The form will need to be told whether the login action was
successful or unsuccessful.

== FUTURE FEATURE IDEAS

 * Form validations
 * Extended RegistrationForm class
 * Adding some transitions to the skin
